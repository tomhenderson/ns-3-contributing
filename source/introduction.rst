Introduction
------------

The |ns3| simulator is a discrete-event network simulator targeted 
primarily for research and educational use.  The 
`ns-3 project
<http://www.nsnam.org>`_, 
started in 2006, is an open-source project developing |ns3|.

|ns3| is extended and maintained by a distributed team of software developers,
and over time, the participants change.  A question often asked by newcomers
is "How can I contribute to |ns3|?" or "How do I get started?"
This document summarizes the various ways and processes used to contribute
to |ns3|.  Contribution by users is essential for the project to continue
to flourish.

The very first step is to become familiar with |ns3| by reading the tutorial,
and then reading some of the code and documentation to get a feel for
things.  From that point, there are a number of options to contribute:

* Contributing a small documentation correction
* Reporting or discussing a newly discovered bug 
* Fixing an already reported bug
* Reviewing code contributed by others
* Submitting new code for inclusion in the main tree
* Alerting the project to related code maintained elsewhere
* Submitting new code as out-of-tree contributed code
* Becoming a maintainer of part of the simulator
* Arranging for your organization to join the ns-3 Consortium

The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  Chapter 2 deals
with general issues surrounding code and documentation contributions, and
introduces the ns-3 Consortium.  Chapter 3 describes approaches for
contributing small enhancements such as a documentation or bug fix.
Chapter 4 outlines the approach for contributing larger amounts of
code to the simulator, such as a new model or module, or some code to
post as contributed code.
